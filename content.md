# Feed the Imaginary

How did we do in early 2023 with Iroco.

## Meta (preparatory) workshop with CEO/CTO

- congruence and alignment
- how do we see our desirable future (individually)
- street observations
- resonance

Outputs:
- finding values and keywords
- building a pitch

## Workshop with external ppl

- using the above pitch / words
- cards

4 steps

- resonance by pairs on values/keywords
- narrative building by small teams with cards
- telling the story to others groups
- global feedback


# Story types

# Why telling stories?

Since Aristotle we know that it is more persuasive.

- logos (logic, reasoning)
- ethos (trust, authority)           => persuasion
- pathos (emotion, beliefs)


Ppl remember 22 times more stories than facts alone (Jenifer Aaker, stanford univ.)


Auto-realization : story about possible reality


----------
Iroco workshop content perse


Conception of ICT

- storage
- communication

decentralisaiton, archipellisation

alignement et enrichissement mutuels entre humains nécessaires à la construction d'un récit collectif

Ex : frugalité

constraints that prevent the emergence of these imaginaries

- Amish and oil lamp : what is progress anyway ?
- safe place : emotions v.s. rationality
- fear for tech ppl to lose
- loss of confort that prevent slow down
- Elul : tech is feeding tech

Steve Jobs: reality distorsion and vision
bottom up v.s. top down

collaborative and sourced


Harari human ability to create stories, and thus create culture. Common stories : recognition and social construction, cultural grounding, cohesion.
GIEC : is that a big story ?


-------
I find quite conceited, pretentious to expose a vision of an ICT imaginary for the future.
At the same time we've seen how important it is to make it happen.

How do we do that?

One answser could be by collective intelligence.

Ex : 
- Fresque du Climat, Fresque du numérique
- Renaissance écologique
- Yesterday canvas
- ask users or stakeholders with workshops

Fresque : establish causality between cards. Discuss

Renaissance : Drawing of an ideal city in 2050 after ecological transition.

Elements : 
- representation, illustration of real or future
- a process made to make ideas emerge collectively
- a safe place to make discussion happen

Iroco: 
- meta workshop to build workshops
- test with friends or relatives
- deploy more widelely

What came out from the one we did?

- digital is usefull for a lot of things. Unconceivable to stop using it, but how could we reduce the way we are using it?
- decentralized, digital farms or data mills
- rethink our models use collective strengths, and collective building

How could we continue using it like we are doing with copper and other raw materials depletion?
With diplomatic crisis?
